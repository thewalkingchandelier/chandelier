    <h1 class="methods">Methods</h1>
    <p>Exploratory design; mainly used for developing a product and testing on potential user groups. Example: Development of a vibrotactile jacket with 14 vibration actuators (causes haptic feedback based on an action) that are triggered by game scripts.
        Includes virtual elements that are used for allyship, enemies, or direction. Gestures include open palm, touch, pinch, and double click.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Participatory Design; Method to actively involve stakeholders. Example: Randomly assigning participants to serious game intervention, gamification methods, but nongames, and tradtional teaching methods. Pretest/posttest design and ANOVA statistical analysis performed</p>
    <br>
    <p>Between groups subjects design; Two groups that receive different intervention methods. Example: of slide-based lecture training and VR serious games in healthcare fire safety training.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Meta-analysis; An aggregation of study data that is analyzed with the purpose of developing a comprehensive conclusion. Example: Nine studies that examine various mental health disorders (i.e. alcohol use disorder, ADHD). The studies included interventions with goal-oriented and cognitive based games. </p>

    <h1 class="leading-theories">Leading Theories</h1>
    <p>"People are moving more toward a virtual world which leads them to believe something is missing in their reality." This stems from the idea that people are making a "mass exodus" toward gaming and alternate reality mindsets where they want to feel powerful and heroic in the way games make them feel (Reality is Broken, 2011).</p>
    <br>
    <p>Gamification and serious games can be used to improve sex education courses in post-secondary schools. There were significant variances between groups in the posttest that received the intervention versus those that did not.(Haruna et al., 2021) </p>
    <br>
    <p>The results indicated that the VR SG was more effective than the slide-based lecture in terms of knowledge acquisition and retention and in terms of self-efficacy increment in short and long terms(Haruna et al., 2021)</p>
    <br>
    <p>There is a moderate effect of preferring serious games in terms of improving mental health symptoms(Lau et al., 2016), but there is low evidence to determine if serious games will improve depression symptoms (Abd-Alrazaq et al., 2022).</p>

    <h1 class="user-groups">User Groups</h1>
    <p>Serious games are heavily used in education among students in primary, secondary, and postsecondary levels. Studies show moderate to strong levels of retenttion of concepts though serious games than traditional methods. Serious games are also used in industry for skills and onboarding training (healthcare, arts/entertainment). </p>
