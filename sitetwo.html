    <p>Milgram et al reality-virtuality (RV) continuum was introduced in 1994 to framework mixed reality to conceptualized research and design. It's based around two extrema- reality and virtuality. Everything in between is Mixed Reality. (Speicher et al., 2019) </p>

    <h2>Definitions of AR</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Merging of 3D graphics with the real world and spatial registration in the physical environment</li>
        <li>Combination of the human, the digital, and the physical world</li>
        <li>Always occurs in the space you are in, cannot be independent of the user, user is always in control, and it enhances the physical space</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Definitions of VR</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fully synthetic view</li>
        <li>Fully constructed reality</li>
        <li>A head mounted display is necessary</li>
        <li>The far end of the MR spectrum</li>
    </ul>
    <p>AR hypnosis and ordinary was tested on males and females as a means of a psychological stress intervention. Results show that AR psychotherapy was more effective than ordinary, specifically on females (Zhao et al., 2015).</p>
    <p>Factors such as age, video game knowledge, predisposition to immersion, likelihood of cybersickeness are factors that contribute to the VRE experience (Rosa et al., 2016)</p>
    <h1 class="user-groups">User Groups</h1>
    <p>General user groups include those in the entertainment, healthcare, web, and education industry. In education, teachers find VR beneficial through virtual laboratories, classrooms, field trips, science, and safety training (Slater, 2009.)
        Cluster analysis and multiple correspondence analysis showed that individuals that are more Predisposed to immersive with higher levels of video game knowledge (known as the PC gamer profile) were associated with higher levels of virtual reality effectiveness snd lower levels of cyber sickness than the console gamer and nongamer profiles (Rosa et al., 2016). VR and AR is often used in conjunction with other technologies.
