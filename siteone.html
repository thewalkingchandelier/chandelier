    <p>The term “stress” is an umbrella term representing experiences in which changes in the environment outweigh an individual’s perceived ability to cope with those changes effectively (Cohen et al., 2016). Environmental stressors can be physical and psychological, but this research on stress in college students will have a primary focus on psychological stress. Scales were often used to measure stress. The Life Events and Difficulties Schedule (LEDS) was introduced in 1978, which was a structured interview that is considered the standard for measuring stressors across someone's lifetime (Crosswell & Lockwood, 2020). LEDS requires a trained interviewer to ask questions about an event or series of events where the interviewee should provide details such as their age at the time, or how long did the event go on for. In 2018, the Stress and Adversity Inventory (STRAIN) was introduced as a measurement of stress. It is a computer-assisted measurement tool that can be completed by a trained interviewer or the participants themselves. LEDS and STRAIN are similar to one another in the sense of the types of core and follow up questions that are asked surrounding stressful events. It is important to note that levels of stress can be influenced by the *perceived* stress that an individual has toward an event versus the actual stress impact if an event. (Crosswell & Lockwood, 2020)</p>

    <p>The Three Dimensional Wisdom Scale (3D-WS) is a 39-item assessment tool that was developed to assess the quality of mental health, and has been used in participant groups of young adults since wisdom has been associated with better mental health and quality of life (Thomas et al., 2016). However, an abbreviated 12-item 3D-WS has been developed because the length of a 39-item tool can be cumbersome for participants (Thomas et al., 2016). </p>
    <br>
    <p>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) was developed in 1983, which is an instrument that assesses how individuals perceive stress in certain situations. It is a self report questionnaire that asks questiions that illicit a reponse in a Likert scale format. Literature review suggests that the 10-item PSS is superior to the 14-item PSS, and the 4-item test is the least favorable (Lee, 2012). </p>

    <h1 class="leading-theories">Leading Theories</h1>
    <p>This current review of literature presents theories related to stress in collge student, with some findings related to working college students.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>College students face a moderate level of academic and environmental stress. Gender and Cumulative GPA of the students were also found not to be statistically significant. However, CGPA was found to have a slight statistically significant relationship with the level of environmental stress (Yikealo et al., 2018). </li>
        <li>Web-based stress management interventions at three different semesters were significant for perceived stress, stress symptoms, and boredom (but not depression or anxiety) (Frazier et al., 2023)</li>
        <li>Optimism and stress are significantly correlated with risk for job burnout (Chang et al., 2000)</li>
        <li>Time spent studying or working have no significang affect on academic performance, but it's worth looking at nonablity factors such as motivation (Nonis & Hudson, 2010)</li>
        
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h1 class="user-groups">User Groups</h1>
    <p>The studies mentioned in the previous section are undergraduate students at North American and Asian universities. It's important to note that many of the participant groups are mostly female, and minority ethnic groups are largely underrepresented. A common method of sampling is by convenience, which is applicable to college campuses.
