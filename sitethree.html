    <h1 class="leading-theories">Leading Theories</h1>
    <p>Kulkarni (2019) states that accessibility refers to the extent to which a product, device, service, or environment is available and navigable for persons with disabilities, or for persons with other special needs or functional limitations. Digital accessibility focuses on access to technology products, resources, and services across hardware and software (Carnegie Melon University 2015, Lazar et al., 2015). </p>
    <br>
    <p>Psychological distress is higher in adult university students with visual impairments than those without (Munaw & Tegegn, 2022). Levels of vision impairment and the length of time with said imparment are significant contributing factors to levels of reported distress. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Audio-AR can be used for Orientation and Mobility training in visually impaired individuals (Wei et al., 2022).</p>
    <br>
    <p>AR technology that uses RFID and IoT to assist people in wheelchairs with browsing items on a shelf. Shelf items have not fully been explored as IoT actors (Rashid et al., 2017). </p>
    <br>
    <p>Augmented, virtual, and mixed reality (AVMR) instruction to reduce library anxiety and to redesign information literacy (IL) courses taught at the library (Sample, 2020).</p>
    <br>
    <p>There is evidence that use of text and object recognition in AR solutions can assist visually impaired elderly people with ensuring they are taking the orrect drug dosage (Ouali et al., 2020).  </p>
 
    <h1 class="user-groups">User Groups</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Approximately 2.2 billion people globally have a near or distant vision impairment (Vision Impairment and Blindness, n.d.). Nearly 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women have CVD. The use of augmented reality solutions are increasing in the education, tourism, and e-commerce industries. It is predicted that there will be 1.73 billion mobile AR users by 2024 (Global Mobile Augmented Reality (AR) User Devices 2024, n.d.). AR solutions being implemented as a means of education in training across multiple age groups.</p>
